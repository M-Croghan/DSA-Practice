# DATA STRUCTURES & ADVANACED DATA TYPES
### DATA STRUCTURES
"A way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively".
- Essential in creating fast & powerful algorithms.
- Helps manage & organize data.
- Makes code cleaner & easier to understand.

### ABSTRACT DATA TYPES
An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data type which only provides
an interface of which a data structure must adhere to. The interface does not
give any specific details about how something should be implemented. (i.e. what language).


### DS & ADT EXAMPLE:
* General example:
  * ADT -> Vehicle
    * DS -> Truck, Golf Cart, Bike
* Specific:
  * ADT -> List
    * DS -> Dynamic Array, Linked List 
  * ADT -> Queue
    * DS -> Queue based on: Linked List, Array, Stack 
  * ADT -> Map 
    * DS -> Tree Map || Hash Map / Hash Table
