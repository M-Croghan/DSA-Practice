# OVERVIEW: GRAPHS

## INTRODUCTION
Graphs can be seen in the associations built between individuals and things on social media platforms and GPS software that helps guide us and provide directions 
when navigating to another location.

In code, they are represented by:
- Adjacency List: A collection of arrays for each node.
- Adjacency Matrix: A 2D Array
