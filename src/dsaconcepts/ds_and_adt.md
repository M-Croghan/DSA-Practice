*** Data Structure ***
"A way of organizing data so that it can be used effectively".
-- Essential in creating fast & powerful algorithms.
-- Helps manage & organize data.
-- Makes code cleaner & easier to understand.

*** Abstract Data Type ***
An abstract data type (ADT) is an abstraction of a data type which only provides
an interface of which a data structure must adhere to. The interface does not
give any specific details about how something should be implemented. (i.e. what language).

[General Example]
[ADT -> Vehicle | DS -> Truck, Golf Cart, Bike]
----------------------------------------------------
ADT -> List || DS -> Dynamic Array, Linked List
ADT -> Queue || DS -> Queue based on: Linked List, Array, Stack
ADT -> Map || DS -> Tree Map || Hash Map / Hash Table
