# OVERVIEW: SETS
## INTRODUCTION
Sets fall in with other list like data structures: Arrays, Lists, Stacks, and Queues. However, sets include only unique values
and thus cannot contain any duplicates.

### Set Methods
Sets maintain standard methods such as .length, .insert, .remove, .has, but also have some interesting methods as well.

- .union() - Returns the combined values between 2 sets.
- .intersect() - Returns the values that exist in both sets.
- .difference() - Returns the values that appear in only 1 of the 2 sets.
