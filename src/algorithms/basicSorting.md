## BASIC SORTING ALGORITHMS - (Bubble, Insertion, Selection)
### The 'Long Division' of Sorting Algorithms
The sorting algorithms in this category can be compared to learning how to do long division in grade school. Division could have been done more faster
and more efficiently if we were to simply use a calculator, however learning the fundamentals by which division works builds the foundation for tackling
more advanced mathematical concepts.
