# ALGORITHMIC PROBLEM SOLVING: DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS 

## INTRODUCTION
As a fresh computer science graduate, it became glaringly obvious that I had a tremendous amount to learn
in the way of solving complex problems. While I had been exposed to data structures and algorithms, my confidence
/ proficiency in using them was lacking. Knowing that the barrier for an entry-level software engineering position
would include coding challenges and technical questions surrounding these important topics, I started this project
as a way to _"learn by doing"_.  

Some of my greatest breakthroughs in understanding have come through the deliberate and mindful exploration of a
topic, as opposed to merely attending a lecture, watching a video, or reading a book. The best learning comes through
directed practice and this project serves as a journey to mastering these vitally important skills and concepts.    

My goal is to become the best engineer I can be, someone a team ***wants*** to have on their side to help solve complex
issues and help others gain insight in this critically important area of computer science. 

This project is broken down into 5 key areas:
* DS&A Concepts: Analyzing Space / Time Complexity
* Data Structures: Implementation from Scratch
* Algorithms: Searching, Sorting, & Beyond
* Problem-Solving: Common Coding Problems
* Design Patterns: Solving Common Problems
