## BASIC SORTING ALGORITHMS - (Bubble, Insertion, Selection)
### The 'Long Division' of Sorting Algorithms
The sorting algorithms in this category can be compared to learning how to do long division in grade school. Division could have been done faster
and more efficiently if we were to simply use a calculator, however learning the fundamentals by which division works builds the foundation for tackling
more advanced mathematical concepts. Learning basic sorting is much the same, in understanding how some of these less optimal sorting methods work,
the foundation is laid for understanding more involved approaches to sorting.

## Bubble Sort
Bubble Sort compares two items and makes swaps as it iterates over an array until no swaps need to be made.

***Complexity:***
- ***Time:*** O(N^2)
- ***Space:*** O(1)

## Insertion Sort
Insertion sort takes each element and inserts them into the correct position. The first item is considered already sorted.
While Bubble and Selection sort only have value in building an understanding of sorting. Insertion sort does excel in 
one area: relatively small number of inputs or where the data is nearly sorted. In these cases the time complexity can 
decrease to O(n).

- ***Time:*** O(N^2)
- ***Space:*** O(1)
