# DATA STRUCTURES & ALGORITHMS NOTEBOOK!

Like all fresh computer science graduates - job preparation and interviewing lies ahead.
Admittedly, I have a tremendous amount to learn as I embark on my career. Its stressful & daunting...
But the best way I have found to gain from the struggle is to organize my effort as best as I can.

I figured I could blend honing my skills by keeping a repo of my studies as it relates to DS&A and
LeetCode style practice while simultaneously honing my Git skills. I know IDEs & Desktop apps make VCS a breeze
but I worry about not having a grater knowledge on pushing / pulling via the command line.
