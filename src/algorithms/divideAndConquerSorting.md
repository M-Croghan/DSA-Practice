# DIVIDE & CONQUER SORTING ALGORITHMS - (Merge Sort, Quick Sort)

## MERGE SORT
Merge sort splits a collection repeatedly until the collection is broken into individual pieces.  
After split apart, it is merged back together in sorted order. Overall, it is based on two main premises:
* A single item list is easy to sort.
* Creating 1 large sort from 2 smaller sorts.  

Technically, merge sort involves ***two*** algorithms:
* Merge sort - O(log n)
* Merge - O(n)
