public class Stack {

    // One-ended linear data structure which models a real world stack (maye a stack of plates).
    // LIFO - Last In, First Out
    // Two major operations: .push() - adds to the top stack || .pop() - removes first item on top of the stack.

    /* Interesting places where Stacks are found:
    * - Undo mechanisms in text-editors.
    * - Compiler Syntax Checking (Braces & Brackets <-- A common technical problem, "Valid brackets")
    * - Supports recursion by keeping track of function calls
    *
    * MAIN OPERATIONS:
    * - POP -> Removes top element on the stack
    * - PUSH -> Adds an element to the top of the stack
    * - PEEK -> Examines the top element in the stack
    *  */
