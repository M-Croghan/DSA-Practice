#OVERVIEW: DESIGN PATTERNS
## INTRODUCTION

There exist 3 aspects of any design pattern:
- A common problem
- A generic standard solution
- Many implementations of that solution  

Expanding on this, there is a template / list of best practices in solving a problem:
- Describe a general solution
- Explain the relationship and interaction between classes & objects
- Help better understand / contextualize the problem

##TYPES OF DESIGN PATTERNS
### Creational
Associated with the creation of classes & objects:
- Singleton: Restricts a class / object to a single instance (i.e. a database connection).
- Abstract Factory: Creates families of related objects without specifying a concrete class for each object.
- Factory:
- Prototype:
- Builder:
- Object Pool:

### Structural
Helps you understand and work with the relationships between classes & objects.
- Decorator:

### Behavioral
One of the most important design patterns in software engineering today. Identifies communication
patterns between objects and realizes those patterns.
- Iterator: Stores traversals into a separate object.
- Command: Turns a request into a stand-alone object with all the information related to that request.
  - Makes it easier to set parameters to set for / or delay a request.
